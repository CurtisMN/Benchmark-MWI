Benchmark test for Midwestern Interactive, by Curtis Nollner.

Personality Test
================

Taking the Classical Enneagram Test, I appear to be type 5.

Communication Skills 
====================

I took a small amount of liberty in deciding what assets were required.

Code Test
=========

I built the page using React/Gatsby. Gatsby allows static pages to be load extremely fast,
especially between pages. While that can't really be utilized in the single page I created,
if it was a fully fledged site you could expect pages to load nearly instantaneously. 

The page should be able to be resized dynamically to any realistic resolution, from my 
4k screen to an outdated smartphone. I will provide a [live version of the site here.](https://relaxed-bohr-ff0a41.netlify.com/)

[Here is the gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/CurtisMN/mwi-benchmark) I was using during the process of creating the page,
in case you wanted to see that for one reason or another.


JS Test
=======

The code for the JS test can be found in [src/components/jstest.js](https://github.com/CurtisMN/Benchmark-MWI/blob/master/src/components/jstest.js)

### PS
Since I made this all on GitLab and was planning on just pushing it to GitHub in a single commit, I was waiting until that commit to do  curtis_nollner-02-2019 as per the instructions, but it seems GitHub kept all the information from the commits made to GitLab, so I'm sorry about that inconvenience.
